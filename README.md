### Java Algorithms implementation

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in Java.
## Contents
The repository contains the following folders:
algorithms/src: This folder contains the Java source code for the algorithms and data structures.
dataStructures/src: This folder contains the Java source code for the algorithms and data structures.

To use any of the algorithms or data structures in your Java project, you can simply copy the relevant Java files from the src folder into your own project. You can also run the JUnit test cases in the test folder to ensure that the implementations are correct.
